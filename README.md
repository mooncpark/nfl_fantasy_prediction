## Background

NFL fantasy football is a game that gives fans the chance to act as general managers by creating teams of their own using real NFL athletes. Fantasy team managers start this team-creation process with a draft where they select a certain number of players across multiple NFL positions. After completing the draft, fantasy managers can then make trades with other managers and add/drop players from their teams. The final goal is to beat out the competition by scoring the most fantasy points on a week-by-week basis when the games are actually played. Fantasy points are based on the actual real game performance of the NFL players that comprise each managerâ€™s team.

## Goal

The goal of our project is to provide NFL fantasy football team managers with informative and comprehensive fantasy performance prediction data. Our MVP is a dashboard that will go beyond what other platforms offer, incorporating machine learning methods to provide weekly points projections, player categorizations, injury status, and sentiment analysis. By providing prediction data and visualizations not included in other public tools and algorithms, we believe our projections can be more accurate and give users the edge they need to win their fantasy leagues.
